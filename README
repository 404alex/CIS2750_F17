1. Use make command to generate the static library.
2. the printInfo function will return a pointer, which need to be freed after use.
3. the printError function will return a string, which do not need to be freed after use.
4. when use make file, because in the bin folder do not have core file and .so file, so
   the command will report an error, but it won't affect the generate static library
   process.
5. when need compile the main file, you need put -Iinclude, -L bin -lllist, -lcparse
   flags.

Everything others,  should.. be fine...
